    <!-- javascript is used in both frontend and backend -->

    <!-- What is NodeJS and why is it used? -->
    <!-- Node. js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome, which compiles JavaScript into efficient machine code.  -->

    <!-- tip - just type .box and see what the emmet gives  -->

    <!-- js is also used  for the putting the validation on frontend webform -->
    <!-- for ex- we can put form validation on netflix clone - that no one can submit email which dont contain "@"  -->
    
    <!-- apart from that it can be used in backend and serverside scripting to pull data from server and send it to server  -->

    <!-- we will now learn js by which we will be able to manipulate button , play with DOM , ID , Class & query selector on frontend -->

    <!-- at this time we have installed node in our pc  -->
    <!--check it by typing node -- version on powershell  -->
    <!-- also check npm --version  -->

    <!-- nodejs is java script based v8 engine used by chrome to run our script  -->
    <!-- some one took the js runtime and put it in c++ . and now we were able to use the power of javascript in Computer also -->
    <!-- hance now we can run the js program as like any other language with the help of node  -->

    <!-- ex - type node script.js in terminal and this javascript will run without browser  -->
    <!-- note - but some keywords like alert , confirm & promt cant be recognise without browser -->

    <!-- hance node js is to run  javascript on pc  -->

    <!-- we can use node to do some task like 
     1 organising the content of folder 
     2 making new folders 
     3 moving files from one folder to other
     4 download the file from internet   -->

    <!-- this tasks are possible by coding it in javascript and running it with node  -->
    <!-- we will also learn to make the backend with the help of node  -->

    <!-- js can be used in both frontend and backend - for backend we need node to run it and for front end we just make the script tag and it can be run browser  -->
    <!-- here js on browser and on node js are somewhat different bcz we get extra elements on browser js  -->
    <!-- ex - promt , confirm , document.getelementbyid , window object , document object & etc. we get extra on browser -->

    <!-- also we get benifits in running js by node for ex - we can read ,write, print  and aulter the file or folder contents -->
    <!-- both are js only . both have same syntax . difference is just that node is using js at backend or on pc & the js which is written in script tag is just for browser and both have some extra elements required to the needs  -->

    <!-- npm - its package manager of node - we can access the others code or package with the help of node  -->
    <!-- we will also install the packages of npm  in future  -->
